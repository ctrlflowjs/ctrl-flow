# persistence of workflows and querying
# enough to set a minimal baseline for the project
# the truly minimal version of this project


# i'm balancing an avoidance of sunk time
# with a need to have a useful prototype to get feedback on


# and a sense that I should be building in one consistent direction
# that's dumb. that's a misconception of how things get created
# but maybe i also feel like i need something solid to anchor myself in
# i think i need a better idea of what my prototype is, the work involved, and what it's for

# you're allowed to not be perfect. you don't need to be perfect. you need to move in the right direction.
# and you'll get better over time.
