ctrlflow is a JS framework that **extends your web application into a no-code process automation platform**. It provides a no-code workflow builder UI for business users, backed by an execution engine that runs inside your app. Easily expose your app functionality to users in the form of no-code modules, and further extend it with chosen modules pulled from the open source community.

The problem with typical SaaS no-code platforms is they give non-technical users more power than they know what to do with while leaving developer extensibility and support as an afterthought. ctrlflow inverts the control, empowering developers to support a competitive no-code user experience, design what users should and shouldn't be able to do in no-code, and do it all without compromising the ability to write, test, debug, review, secure, and monitor applications like professionals.

The project is v0 and still in early development. v0 releases are expected to run (please give it a try and share feedback!), just be warned that there will be bugs, and preserving backwards compatibility is not yet a priority.

## Getting Started

Adding ctrlflow to your app is designed to be as easy as possible:

1) Install it in your backend `npm install @ctrlflow/core`
2) Define your app with modules and a storage provider
3) Start the app runtime and plug in the UI server

## License

ctrlflow is free and open source software with an MIT license. Depending on how the project matures, a subscription based pro version may also be added under a separate license, which would include a support plan and advanced controls aimed at larger businesses.
