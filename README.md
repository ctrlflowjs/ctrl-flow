ctrlflow is a JS framework for turning web applications into **home grown no-code process automation platforms**. It provides a no-code workflow builder UI for business users, backed by an execution engine that runs inside your app. Easily make no-code modules available to your users, each of them backed by code you write as easily as an express handler, or pull from the open source community. Decide for yourself what your users can and should be able to do in no-code, unlike traditional platforms that give

The project is v0 and still in early development. v0 releases are always expected to run (please give it a try and share feedback!) just be warned that there will be bugs, and preserving backwards compatibility is not yet a priority.

## Getting Started

Adding ctrlflow to your app is designed to be as easy as possible:

1) Install it in your backend `npm install @ctrlflow/core`
2) Define your app with modules and a storage provider
3) Start the app runtime and plug in the UI server

## License

ctrlflow is free and open source software with an MIT license. Depending on how the project matures, a subscription based pro version may also be added under a separate license, which would include a support plan and advanced controls aimed at larger businesses.
